# Gas-Station-Code
This is a basic code for a gas station that calculates the price of gas and/or market items.

# Description
This code is designed to simulate a gas station that sells gas and market items. The code takes in the quantity of gas or market items that the customer wants to purchase and calculates the total cost based on the current price.

The code includes two functions: gas and market. The gas function takes in the quantity of gas and returns the total price. The market function takes in the quantity of market items and returns the total price.

# Usage

The code will prompt the user to enter the quantity of gas and/or market items they wish to purchase. The code will then calculate the total cost based on the current price and display the result to the user.
